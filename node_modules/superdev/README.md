## Getting Started

Create a `docs` folder and `docs/index.mdx` file.

```mdx
import MyComponent from '../src'

# Component Demo

<MyComponent
  beep='boop'
/>
```

Start the dev server on the `docs` folder:

```sh
mdx-go docs
```

### npm run scripts

Alternatively, mdx-go can be installed as a development dependency and used with run scripts in your `package.json`.

```json
"scripts": {
  "dev": "mdx-go docs",
  "docs": "mdx-go build docs"
}
```

```sh
npm run dev
```

## Motivation

mdx-go is built with the idea of **[Progressive Documentation][]** in mind,
intended to be used anywhere as a dev server, prototyping tool, or simple static site generator.
By embracing the MDX file format, the docs you create with mdx-go can easily be used in other tools.
Start your docs with mdx-go and migrate to tools like [Next.js][] and [Gatsby][] when needed.
You can even keep mdx-go around to use as a dev tool outside of other React applications.

[Gatsby]: https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby

## Using MDX

MDX combines the simplicity of markdown with the ability to import and use React components inline.

Write markdown like you normally would.

```md
# Hello
```

Import and use React components inline.

```mdx
import { Box } from 'grid-styled'

# Hello

<Box p={3} bg='tomato'>
  This is a React component!
</Box>
```

To learn more about using MDX, see the [MDX docs][MDX].

## Routing

Each MDX file in the target directory will become its own route,
with `index.mdx` serving as the base route, i.e. `/`.

With the following directory structure:

```
docs/
  index.mdx
  getting-started.mdx
  api.mdx
```

mdx-go will create routes for `/`, `/getting-started`, and `/api`.

mdx-go also supports using React components as routes for files with the `.js` extension.
Be sure that the `.js` file exports a default component to render as a route.

## Layouts

mdx-go includes a default layout that centers the document in the viewport,
but custom layout components can be added both globally and per-route.

To render a custom layout for a single route, export a component as the `default` from the MDX file.
This is a built-in [feature of MDX](https://mdxjs.com/syntax#export-default).

```mdx
import Layout from './Layout'

export default Layout

# Page with layout
```

To wrap all routes with a custom layout, export a `Root` component from your `index.mdx` file.
This will completely disable the built-in centered layout.
Note: this only works in the `index` route, not other routes.

```mdx
export { Root } from './Root'

# Root layout for all routes
```

## Head Content

Head contents can be set per-route by using the `Head` component.

```mdx
import { Head } from 'mdx-go'

<Head>
  <title>Page title</title>
</Head>

# Page with title
```

To set head contents for all routes, use the Head component within a [`Root` component](#layouts).

## Custom MDX Components

To customize the HTML components rendered from MDX, use the `ComponentProvider` in a [`Root` component](#layouts).

```js
// example Root component
import React from 'react'
import { ComponentProvider } from 'mdx-go'

const components = {
  h1: props => <h1 {...props} style={{ fontSize: 48 }} />,
}

export const Root = props =>
  <ComponentProvider components={components}>
    {props.children}
  </ComponentProvider>
```

Ensure the Root component is exported from `index.mdx`

```mdx
export { Root } from './Root.js'
```

## Custom File Match Pattern

To specify a custom file pattern for matching against,
export a `files` webpack context from the main `index.mdx` file.

```mdx
export const files = require.context('../src', true, /\.example\.js$/, 'lazy')
```

## Theming

By default mdx-go includes virtually no styling. To customize the styles, use components to
wrap MDX with a [Root component](#layouts) and use the [MDXProvider](#custom-mdx-components) to change the default styles.

## Exporting

To export as a static site with HTML and JS bundles, run:

```sh
mdx-go build docs
```

This will export all routes as HTML in a `dist` folder.
See [CLI Options](#cli-options) for configuration options.

## CSS-in-JS

mdx-go does not use any CSS-in-JS libraries internally, and most libraries will work when using the dev server.
To extract static CSS when using the `build` command, ensure you have either `styled-components` or `emotion` installed locally in your `package.json`.
For Emotion, be sure that `emotion-server` is also installed.

When either of these libraries are detected in your `package.json` dependencies, mdx-go will extract static CSS during the build process.

## CLI Options

The following flags can be passed to the CLI.

```
  -p --port     Port for dev server
  --no-open     Disable opening in default browser
  -d --out-dir  Output directory for static export
  --basename    Base path for routing
  --static      Export HTML without JS bundle
  --webpack     Path to custom webpack config
```

All CLI options can also be specified in a `mdx-go` field in your `package.json`.

```json
"mdx-go": {
  "outDir": "site"
}
```

## Custom webpack config

mdx-go will automatically pick up a `webpack.config.js` if it exists in the current working directory.
A custom path can be passed to the CLI using the `--webpack` flag.
The provided webpack config will be merged with the built-in config using [webpack-merge][].
